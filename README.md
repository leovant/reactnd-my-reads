This is my solution to the MyReads project of the [React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

I used [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as components library.

I applied in-line styles to the components/elements because I had little and specific changes that, in my opinion, do not require the use of a more elegant way to handle CSS.

## Running it

1. Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leovant/reactnd-my-reads.git
```

2. Access the directory and install dependencies:

```bash
$ cd <direcotory_of_the_app>
$ npm install
```

3. Start the app:

```bash
$ npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
